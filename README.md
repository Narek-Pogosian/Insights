# 📊 Insights: Survey Creation App

Welcome to **Insights**, this app empowers users to easily create, share, and collect feedback from surveys.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Survey Creation and Editing**: Easily create and modify surveys with a user-friendly interface.
- **Single Response Limitation**: Each participant can respond to a survey only once based on their IP address.
- **CSV Export**: Download all survey responses in CSV format for analysis.
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login system for users.

## 🌟 Project Status

This project is currently inactive as I have chosen to shift my focus towards exploring technologies beyond Next.js and React. Throughout the development of this project, I have gained significant insights and proficiency with Next.js.

In retrospect, there are several aspects I would approach differently. For instance, I would prioritize planning the user experience for the survey creation components. Additionally, I would consider utilizing tRPC instead of server actions, as it simplifies client-side code for data fetching and revalidation, which may be more suited to this project's needs.
